		#LOC_mk2l-agent = Kwark Kerman's Builds & Bars
		
		#LOC_mk2l-aeronose-title = Lobe Aerodynamic Nose
		#LOC_mk2l-aeronose-desc = A very pointy front end for the stack is very helpful with the water landings and speedboat builds. Well that's what the marketing guy said. Mileage may vary.
		#LOC_mk2l-aeronose-tags = nose tail aero swept curve
		
		#LOC_mk2l-aerotail-title = Lobe Aerodynamic Tail
		#LOC_mk2l-aerotail-desc = We don't always want something on the end belching hot air. Sometimes we just want a sleek, flashy hull and for it to hold some more brandy. So here we go.
		#LOC_mk2l-aerotail-tags = nose tail aero swept curve
		
		#LOC_mk2l-batt-title = Lobe Battery
		#LOC_mk2l-batt-desc = What can we say? It's a battery but in the best shape ever.
		#LOC_mk2l-batt-tags = elec stor charge energ
		
		#LOC_mk2l-cargobay-title = Lobe Payload Bay

		#LOC_mk2l-engsj-title = Lobe Strutjet
		#LOC_mk2l-engsj-desc = Not all of our clients' winged landers have main engines with a big, screechy turbine in them and are slow to take off when they leave. Some prefer engines that enable vertical or fast takeoff and are super-efficient in the opposite way. Rocket mode drinks its brandy more elegantly and air-breathing mode can inhale the flames like a champ.
		#LOC_mk2l-engsj-tags = engine thrust rocket ram scram
		
		#LOC_mk2l-engvas-title = Lobe Vertical Aerospike
		#LOC_mk2l-engvas-desc = We know our clients love to spike their landers (with the T-1) because of how good it is, both in the void and in the thickest atmosphere. They're absolutely going to come barging in with mouths and wallets wide open for this lovely piece of hardware.
		#LOC_mk2l-engvas-tags = spike lift vtol thrust rocket land
		
		#LOC_mk2l-engvtf-title = Lobe Vertical Turbofan
		#LOC_mk2l-engvtf-desc = Tip-toeing in atmosphere is hard. Finding enough puny lift engines and making room for them to hold themselves up is harder. To meet our clients' growing needs for adequate tip-toe power we took a pair of Wheesley engines, joined them at the hip and gave them a taste for stronger brandy.
		#LOC_mk2l-engvtf-tags = air turbo wheesley vtol thrust jet land
		#LOC_mk2l-engvtf-alternator1 = Alternator (Cruise)
		#LOC_mk2l-engvtf-alternator2 = Alternator (Power Lift)
		
		#LOC_mk2l-intake-title = Lobe Variable Intake
		#LOC_mk2l-intake-desc = We've seen a lot of faces in our time. We've seen some odd nostrils on some of them too...
		#LOC_mk2l-intake-tags = int air breath ram
		
		#LOC_mk2l-mount-title = Lobe Engine Mount
		#LOC_mk2l-mount-desc = A truly stylish piece which allows for attaching 0.6m or 0.9m engines. Engines sold separately and not in stock yet. Pre-order now!
		#LOC_mk2l-mount-tags = mount eng coupl place adapt
		
		#LOC_mk2l-tankc-title = Lobe Tank Corner
		#LOC_mk2l-tankm-title = Lobe Tank Medium
		#LOC_mk2l-tanks-title = Lobe Tank Short
		#LOC_mk2l-tankv-title = Lobe Tank Variable
		#LOC_mk2l-tankc-desc = Aerodynamic rounded corner for a Mk2 lobe section. It's ok for, well, rounding off a pontoon. It holds as much a a shot glass, though... Big surprise.
		#LOC_mk2l-tankm-desc = Medium tank. Holds a respectable, if small amount of brandy. For use by fuel switchers that don't respect height selection.
		#LOC_mk2l-tank-desc = Short tank. Holds a fairly puny amount of brandy. For use by fuel switchers that don't respect height selection.
		#LOC_mk2l-tankv-desc = We can change the height on this mug.
		#LOC_mk2l-tank-tags = fuel tank config mono liq ox lf
		
		#LOC_mk2l-rcs-title = Lobe RCS Block
		#LOC_mk2l-rcs-desc = Half an RCS cluster is still an RCS cluster so it's still fully priced.
		#LOC_mk2l-rcs-tags = reaction control thrust stabil sas
		
		#LOC_mk2l-rw-title = Lobe Reaction Wheel
		#LOC_mk2l-rw-desc = While you wait for the server to finish with the client ahead of you, here, have some premium fidget spinners.
		#LOC_mk2l-rw-tags = stabil wheel cmg rw control moment gyro sas
		
		#LOC_mk2l-shroud-title = Lobe Engine Shroud
		#LOC_mk2l-shroud-desc = It's a mug. But it holds engines, not brandy.
		#LOC_mk2l-shroud-tags = shroud cowl fairing
