Slicing the carrot the other way, this kit adds a few interesting new options for spaceplane ...or fighter plane design.

Among the engines are a radial strutjet and two inline engines for VTOL.

## Strutjet
A Rocket-Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine for use on VTHL SSTOs. There is no turbojet phase here, instead, there is hypersonic optimization. Rocket --> Ramjet --> Scramjet --> Rocket. This engine type may not have much value on stock scale but it's definitely made for upscale ship builders to test and enjoy.

## VTOL
Inline engines (primarily to face downward) for hovercraft enthusiasts. One is a turbofan. One is an aerospike.
